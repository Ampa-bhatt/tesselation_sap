Operational Efficiency in Retail: A Case Study Using Voronoi Tessellation and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)

Overview

The retail sector faces significant challenges in standardizing metrics to measure operational efficiency. This lack of standardization hampers cross-retailer comparisons and makes informed decision-making difficult. This project aims to address these challenges by presenting a novel application of computational geometry and economic modeling techniques to evaluate the efficiency of retail stores.

Objective

This study combines Voronoi Tessellation (a computational geometry method) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) (a benchmarking technique) to analyze retail stores' efficiency using demographic and operational data. The goal is to empower decision-makers with actionable insights, identifying efficient and inefficient units to enable targeted improvements.

Key Features

Novel Integration: A seamless application of Voronoi Tessellation and DEA for the retail industry, offering a unique approach to operational analysis.

Insights for Decision Makers: Provides clear indicators of store efficiency and inefficiency, guiding remedial actions.

Focused Scope: While not a comparative analysis of tessellation or DEA variants, this project demonstrates their practical implementation for business benefits.
